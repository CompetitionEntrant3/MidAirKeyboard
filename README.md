## Background
7/24/2018
The Virtual Augmented Tactile Mid-Air Keyboard, or VATMAK for short, is a 10-finger mid-air QWERTY virtual keyboard apparatus visualized in a 3D environment. The application's purpose is to provide an efficient, familiar typing interface while requiring no contact with a physical surface. I worked on this project during the summer of 2017 in Prof. Xiaojun Bi's Human-Computer Interaction Lab.
