-- Single-Optimized Phrase Sets --

We denote these phrase sets as “S-<type>-<size>”, “S” stands for “single-optimized”. <type> takes the value of “B” (Bigram Frequency) ,“M” (Memorability) or “W” (Word Clarity). <size> takes the value of 20, 40, 80 or 160.

==============================================================
-- Double-Optimized Phrase Sets --
    
We denote each phrase set as “D-<type1><type2>-<size>”, “D” stands for “double-optimized”, <type1> and <type2> take the value of “B” ,“M” or “W”, <size> takes the value of 20, 40, 80 or 160.

For each combination of two different metrics, we first project the 3D Pareto front onto the 2D metric plane to derive a 2D Pareto front. We then choose the phrase set on the 2D Pareto front that is closest to the 45-degree line. These phrase sets are optimal on two metrics simultaneously.

==============================================================
-- Triple-Optimized Phrase Sets --

We denote each phrase set as “T-<size>”, “T” stands for “triple-optimized”, <size> takes the value of 20, 40, 80 or 160. 

We select the phrase sets on the 3D Pareto front that is closest to the 45-degree line through the space. These phrase sets make a best compromising among the three metrics.
